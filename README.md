  - Node.js: `brew install node` for Mac OS X, `choco install nodejs` for Windows OS
  - Yeoman: `npm install -g yo`
  - Bower `npm install -g bower`
- Install: `npm install -g generator-aspnet`
- Run: `yo aspnet`

> Hey, we encourage you to contribute to .Net Core templates project: [https://github.com/dotnet/templating](https://github.com/dotnet/templating) in order to put community efforts into a single source project used by everyone in ecosystem. Thanks!


The Nancy project is based on framework's "Hello World" template:
[Nancy Getting Started: Introduction](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/Introduction)

The xUnit test project uses [xUnit: a free, open source, community-focused unit testing tool for the .NET Framework](https://xunit.github.io/)

The F# Templates are based on [Core F# Templates](https://github.com/odytrice/core-fsharp-templates) projects. They were translated into F# from the original [ASP.NET Templates](https://github.com/aspnet/Templates) 

The templates that use client-side libraries are calling the `bower install` script to install Bower managed dependencies. You can skip the installation process by passing the `--skip-install` option to the generator, e.g. `yo aspnet --skip-install`. This should allow for a better experience when `Development` has been enabled.

The templates support both `LTS` and `Current` version of runtime. The `LTS` version is enabled by default (or enforced by `--version-lts` option). You can switch to `Current` version at any time by passing `--version-current` option when invoking generator: `yo aspnet --version-current`.

## Command line automation

The project type and application name can be specified as optional command line arguments:

```bash
yo aspnet [projecttype [applicationname] [uiframework]]
```

The valid project types are:

- `web` for Empty Web Application
- `console` for Console Application
- `mvc` for Web Application
- `mvcbasic` for Web Application Basic
- `webapi` for Web API Application
- `nancy` for Nancy ASP.NET Application
- `classlib` for Class Library
- `mstest` MSTest Test project (MSTest)
- `xunit` xUnit Test project (xUnit.net)
- `fsharp_web` for F# Empty Web Application
- `fsharp_console` for F# Console Application
- `fsharp_classlib` for F# Class Library
- `fsharp_webapi` for F# Web API Application
- `fsharp_mvcbasic` for F# Web Application Basic
- `fsharp_mstest` for F# Unit Test project (MSTest)
- `fsharp_xunit` for F# xUnit Test project (xUnit.net)

The valid UI framework types are:

- `bootstrap` for Bootstrap (this is the default and does not have to be specified explicitly)
- `semantic` for Semantic UI

> Example: `yo aspnet mvcbasic "my semantic app" semantic` will create a "Web Application Basic" project called "my semantic app" using the Semantic UI framework.

> Example: `yo aspnet mvcbasic "my bootstrap app"` OR `yo aspnet mvcbasic "my bootstrap app" bootstrap` will create a "Web Application Basic" project called "my bootstrap app" using the Bootstrap framework.

## Sub Generators

The alphabetic list of available sub generators (_to create files after the project has been created_):

* [aspnet:nugetconfig](#nugetconfig)
* [aspnet:webconfig](#webconfig)

** Note: files generated are created in the working directory, no conventions are forced **

[Return to top](#top)

### nugetconfig

Creates a new `NuGet.config` file.

Example:

```
yo aspnet:nugetconfig
```

Produces `NuGet.config`

[Return to top](#top)

### webconfig

Creates a new Web Config file

Example:

```
yo aspnet:webconfig
```

Produces `web.config`
